# Sample Cover Letter - Software Engineer Position

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Software Engineer position at your company. With my background in backend development, distributed systems, and AI/ML engineering, I believe I would be a valuable addition to your team.

During my time at Martı (NYSE:MRT), I developed high-performance microservices in Go that handled millions of daily requests. I architected real-time data pipelines and implemented robust error handling patterns that significantly improved system reliability. My experience spans the full software development lifecycle, from initial design through deployment and monitoring.

At Myelin-H, I had the opportunity to work on cutting-edge AI applications, building production-grade LLM systems and implementing machine learning pipelines. This experience gave me deep insights into both the technical challenges and immense potential of AI-driven solutions.

What excites me most about technology is the opportunity to solve complex problems that have real-world impact. I thrive in collaborative environments where I can learn from talented colleagues while contributing my own expertise in backend systems, data engineering, and automation.

I am particularly drawn to opportunities that offer:
- Technical challenges that push me to grow
- A strong engineering culture focused on quality
- The chance to work with modern technologies
- Collaborative teams building meaningful products

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience align with your team's needs. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Alperen Turkmen
