I’m applying for the AI Programmer role because building intelligent, behaviour-driven systems is exactly the area where I’ve grown the most. During my time in Martı’s AI/Data team, I worked on real production challenges — improving a licence-plate recognition model and building an LLM-based moderation system from scratch. Those projects taught me how to analyse a problem end-to-end, understand the bigger picture, and take ownership of systems that need to be both reliable and performant.

I’ve also spent the last few years developing gameplay systems and tools with Unity and C#, often pairing AI models with game mechanics. Whether it was integrating YOLOv8 for CV tasks, building microservices that communicate in real time, or debugging the behaviour of a model that misread hand-written numbers as licence plates, I learned how to reason about AI like an engineer — isolate the issue, optimise the flow, iterate fast. The Build–Measure–Learn cycle became my default way of working, especially when improving AI behaviour or refining logic with feedback from designers and teammates.

Rebellion’s focus on immersive shooters and sophisticated AI systems is exactly the environment I want to contribute to. I enjoy working in small, experienced teams where you have ownership and the chance to push AI behaviour into something that feels alive. I’d love to bring my AI problem-solving background, my gameplay engineering experience, and my habit of iterating quickly and thoughtfully into your code team.
